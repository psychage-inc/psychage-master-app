// Clarity Score — contextual results copy. Ported from psychage-v2
// src/components/tools/ClarityScore/data/results-content.ts. Two mobile adaptations:
//   1. Tool-link paths remapped to mobile routes. The web's /tools/clarity-journal
//      has no mobile counterpart (Mood Journal folded into Moments, PR #173) — those
//      links go to Today ('/'), where the Moment capture lives (PR-023). Sleep:
//      /tools/sleep-architect→/tools/sleep.
//   2. ONE phrase reframed for the SR-3 constitutional hook: the web's balanced-tier
//      "You have a solid foundation to build on." → "There's a solid foundation to
//      build on." ("you have" is a forbidden diagnostic seed). Meaning preserved;
//      this is the only deviation from verbatim web copy in this file.
//
// Copy is clinical content under the web-parity override — release-gated on Dr. Dobson
// review (workspace CLAUDE.md §7).
